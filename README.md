# Angular + NodeJS / Express + MongoDB with Typescript

Sample project using TypeScript.

Clone the project and then:

  npm install

The global.config.json file contains routes used by client and server, the MongoDB url as required.

To run the servers:

And use default angular route http://localhost:4200.
